## Install Process
### Video
1. Turn off power to the machine. The safest way to do so is to turn off the power switch located inside the coin door. This will ensure that the machine remains grounded while working, reducing the risk of ESD damage to the machine.
2. Open the rear panel of the machine. This panel is typically secured with a single tubular lock located at the top center of the panel, or screws located in the top corners.
3. Disconnect the HDMI cable from the MK9, and connect it to Output 1 on the DVI splitter.
4. Connect the shorter HDMI cable to the HDMI port on the MK9, and the Input port of the HDMI splitter.
5. Connect the long HDMI cable to Output 2 on the HDMI splitter.
6. Connect the power adapter barrel conector to the HDMI splitter, and route the adapter to a power source.

### Audio
1. With the machine still shut down, unplug the 3.5mm audio cable from the motherboard of the MK9, from the port labeled "Green" and plug it into one of the outputs of the 3.5mm splitter.
2. Connect the 3.5mm audio splitter to the port labeled "Green"
3. Connect the new 3.5mm audio cable to the second port of the audio splitter

### Finishing Up
1. Carefully route cables inside the machine, attempting to avoid running parallel to any wires that are brown, green or blue, as these are AC voltage lines, and may cause interference to audio or video signals.
2. Place the video splitter in a safe location. If this will be permanently installed, it may be wise to mount the splitter with two-sided-tape to an open panel, leaving the ports accessible for service. Take care not to pinch or excessively bend any cables.
3. Remove one of the black plastic handles from the rear door of the cabinet, and store the handle inside the cabinet. Route your cables through this service hole.

## Streaming
### Booting
When booting the cabinet for the first time after installing the splitter, you will want to ensure that the audio and video signals are working as expected. You may do this either by allowing the cabinet to boot to the game software and playing a test credit, or by using the audio and video test functions in the service menu.

### Capture Card
Once you have verified that the audio and video are working properly, you should test your capture card. Boot the machine, wait for the game to load, and then connect your streaming equipment.

### Disconnecting
After your streaming event has finished, you will want to clean up the area of the cabinet. If you have permission from the cabinet owner, you may wish to leave the streaming equipment installed. If not, remove the equipment and restore the hardware to its original configuration. If you are leaving the hardware installed, stow any cables inside the cabinet away from electrical components, and replace the black plastic handle into the rear panel.
