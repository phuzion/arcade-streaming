  # Arcade Machine Streaming

  This repository provides documentation on numerous types of arcade rhythm game systems, primarily with the focus of providing information on how to connect to these machines for streaming purposes.

  While we attempt to be comprehensive in our coverage, we cannot account for all variations of arcade machine hardware, software or firmware, and some of this may not work as expected.

  Pull requests are welcome. Priority is given to Bemani games, then other games primarily found in rhythm game tournaments, and then any other games.
